# NgrxRxjs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## app story

ok so the story is you are an event place like 6 flags or disney land. You track customers visits as well as what and where they purchased stuff. so like on a tuesday someone might visit and find a food stand. at that food stand they might buy cotton candy and a doughnut.


1. `customers` have
2. `visits` where they make
3. `transactions` where they purchase 
4. `items`

The example and use cases are acknowledged to be contrived. 

## features

site consists of edit and overview pages for displaying or editing data. pages are painfully similar but are included to reflect different views of the data. a significant amount of component nesting was also included to emulate a more complex application.

`transactions` and `items` both have totals that need to be updated when an `items` price or amount changes.
